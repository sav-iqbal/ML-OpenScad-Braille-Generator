Purpose: 
This braille generator makes it easier to 3D Print. The original generator we used to build this program used spheres rather than a fillet to create braille. However, the prints are too pointy with a sphere, as the printer places dots on top to complete the shape. This also leads to unwanted strings forming. This creates flatter braille and uses less filament. 

Feel free to message us if you run into any issues using the generator.
