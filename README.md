Purpose: 
This braille generator makes it easier to 3D Print. The original generator we used to build this program used spheres rather than a fillet to create braille. However, the prints are too pointy with a sphere, as the printer places dots on top to complete the shape. This also leads to unwanted strings forming. This creates flatter braille and uses less filament. 

Note About Numbers: When using numbers in the generator, make sure to use a "#" as an element before the number. This ensures that the reader can differentiate between a letter and number, as the numbers are the same as letters (a is the same as 1, and so forth). 

Feel free to message us if you run into any issues using the generator.
